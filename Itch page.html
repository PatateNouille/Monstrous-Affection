  <blockquote>
    <p>You were on a nice romantic planet, going on a date with your life's crush...</p>
    <p>The sunset was beautiful... The air felt nice on your skin...</p>
    <p>You were both eating some food you picked on the beach earlier...</p>
    <p>Now that you think of it, that one had an odd shape...</p>
    <p>But before you noticed, it was too late, your crush had ate it.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, as the birds were passing by, while the air smelt like roses, your crush began to make awful sounds...</p>
    <p>Not human sounds... You could see its body starting to shape shift... The skin changing color...</p>
    <p>You almost passed out, and don't remember much of this...</p>
    <p>As you were regaining your focus, you saw, your crush was... Gone, but not completely...</p>
    <p>Somehow, although what it would say had nothing to do with words, you could understand...</p>
    <p>It was hungry... <strong>Very</strong> hungry...</p>
    <p>You started feeding it every food you could find... Soon enough you had used everything on the planet.</p>
    <p>You never were the pilot, only the engineer, but you took the monster in your ship and flew away towards another world.</p>
    <p>You barely can maneuver the ship, yet you manage to reach a new planet with food on its surface.</p>
    <p>However the landing wasn't as smooth... You crashed the ship, you think you'll probably never learn how to properly land...</p>
    <p>But you had to fetch food for your crush, don't let it starve...</p>
    <p><strong>Keep it alive ! You'll do anything for love !</strong></p>
